# CONTEXT INHERITANCE PIPELINE
Project Name: {{ project_name }}
You are tasked to detail **PHASE {{ phase_idx }} OUT OF {{ num_phases }}**. You must align perfectly with the established Global Context, satisfy a subset of the Raw Requirements, and maintain strict continuity of physical files generated in previous phases to avoid collision or duplicate creation.

# PRISTINE INITIAL STATE MANDATE: 
# This is PHASE 1 (The Absolute Baseline Generation Step). 
# There are ZERO preceding code assets, directory structures, or legacy dependencies in the workspace.
# You MUST initialize all module definitions, file paths, database schemas, and data boundaries from a pure zero-state architecture baseline. Do not assume or extrapolate any prior system deployment state.

----------------------------------

# EXTRACTION RULES FOR DAY-BY-DAY EXECUTION LOGS:
1. You MUST break down the operational scope of PHASE {{ phase_idx }} into sequential daily logs, starting from **DAY 1** up to a maximum of **DAY {{ max_days_per_phase }}**.
2. **Strict Grouping Hierarchy:** Day Level ──► Agent Sub-task Level ──► Target Component Level.
3. **Strict Sub-Agent Persona Allocation:** Each Sub-Task belongs to exactly ONE unique Assigned Sub-Agent literal token: 'Coder' | 'Tester' | 'Reviewer' | 'Doc' | 'Docker' | 'GCP' | 'GKE'.
4. **WORKSPACE PATH BOUNDARY & DYNAMIC TOPOLOGY CONSTRAINTS:**
   - **Absolute Workspace Boundary Rule:** The true repository workspace root is permanently fixed at the project root `./`. All file paths generated MUST strictly begin with `./sources/`.
   - **Dynamic Directory Prefixing Compliance:** You MUST strictly match the file path prefixes to the active system topology mapped in the Global Context. Do NOT generate backend folders for frontend-only projects, and do NOT generate frontend folders for backend-only systems.
   - For tester Agent: Each component MUST be declared as a strict semi-colon separated pair: `<source file path to verify by test>;<source test file to execute>`. Both paths inside the pair MUST begin with `./sources/`. If no single source file is isolated for Integration/E2E tests, utilize the literal token `INTEGRATION_SCOPE` as the first parameter.
   - **[CONDITION: JAVA_STACK_ONLY] Java Package Enforcement Rule:** If a file path targets a Java source or test component (.java), you MUST verify that the path contains the directory segment: `/org/nlh4j/sources/<calculated_lowercase_token>/`.

Your output MUST follow this exact Markdown layout structure (translate all label tokens but preserve the hidden HTML anchor formatting exactly):

<RULE>
- **🚨 MASTER GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE MANDATE**: Before generating your final output response, you MUST strictly re-read and enforce the global translation rules defined in the Master Rules section. Ensure 100% of descriptive texts are rendered in {% if language and language.strip() != "" %}{{ language }}{% else %}English{% endif %} while completely freezing all technical paths, tags, and block codes.

## 1. Phase Operational Scope & Objectives
[Provide a rigorous, detailed architectural summary of what this specific phase must implement based on the distributed requirements allocated for Phase {{ phase_idx }}]

## 2. Allowed Technical Scope & Directory Boundaries (Files, paths, and endpoints)
[List the absolute directory matrices and REST/GraphQL/Event endpoint routing patterns allowed for this phase, matching the detected language and active project stack topology. Every directory matrix path must be bounded under `./sources/`]

## 3. Dedicated Sub-Agent Functional Directives
[Delineate the explicit operational constraints and duties for each assigned agent persona in this phase, enforcing strict segregation of technical boundaries as defined below. Human-readable directives, descriptions, and task requirements MUST be contextually translated entirely into {% if language and language.strip() != "" %}{{ language }}{% else %}English{% endif %} following the transmission rails]:block_phase_prompt.user.v5.md

*   **Coder**: Acts as a Senior/Principal Application Developer. Responsible for pure application source code implementation across both backend services and frontend/mobile client applications. Banned from writing test suites or infrastructure manifests.
* **Tester**: Acts as a Lead/Principal QC/QA. Specialized in test suite engineering, validation, and quality gates. Responsible for generating JUnit, integration tests, E2E automation tests, and performance validation scripts. Banned from modifying application production code. If the sub-task target involves an overall integration or end-to-end scope where no single specific code file can be bounded, you MUST strictly output the literal token `INTEGRATION_SCOPE` as the first parameter of the semicolon pair (e.g., `INTEGRATION_SCOPE;./sources/backend/tests/integration/WorkflowTest.java`).
* **Doc**: Functions as a Principal Technical Writer and Enterprise Systems Architect. Specialized in compiling comprehensive Technical Specification documents, schema references, system blueprints, and enterprise architecture catalogs custom-fitted to the active project topology layers. Every single technical document file generated MUST be listed as an explicit file path entity ending with the `.md` extension and reside strictly within the centralized storage layout: `./sources/docs/`.
<RULE>
[CRITICAL_SYSTEM_PIPELINE_RAIL:
- You are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from omitting, dropping, or filtering out the 'Doc' agent from any computed phase logs.
- For EVERY calculated phase generated in your output, on Day 1 of that phase, you MUST explicitly allocate a foundational system documentation task to the 'Doc' agent.
- This task description MUST require the 'Doc' agent to initialize, architect, and map out the complete technical framework manuals, architecture blueprints, data structures, or deployment topologies corresponding to the active stack matrix of that current phase.
- Failing to write the 'Doc' agent inside Day 1 of any phase triggers a fatal pipeline contract breach.

</RULE>
*   **Reviewer**: Responsible for compiler verification, static analysis gating, and defensive patching. Specialized in code quality audits, resolving compilation bugs, fixing OWASP security vulnerabilities, and addressing SonarQube quality gate blockers.
*   **Docker**: Specialized strictly in containerization, multi-stage Dockerfile engineering, package optimization, and pushing verified application image assets to DockerHub.
*   **GCP**: Specialized in cloud automation within Google Cloud Platform. Responsible for building and pushing images to Google Cloud Artifact Registry (GCR), and orchestrating container environments natively on Google Cloud Run.
*   **GKE**: Specialized in production container orchestration inside Google Kubernetes Engine. Responsible for building Kubernetes deployment manifests, routing controls, HPA configurations, Helm charts, and deploying microservices workloads into active GKE clusters.

## 4. Phase Definition of Done (DoD)
[Specify the objective quantitative milestones required to pass this phase successfully, ensuring 100% compliance with OWASP enterprise standards, complete functional test coverage for the allocated requirements, and 100% Tag ID mapping check]

## 5. DAY-BY-DAY ARCHITECTURAL EXECUTION LOGS

# REMINDER: Enforce the 'Longitructural Day Partitioning Guardrail' and 'Anti-Padding Mandate'. Output each active day as an isolated standalone single integer subsection header from DAY 1 up to the dynamic freeze day. Do NOT generate empty padded days.

#### 📝 [TRANSLATED SUB-TASK] [X.Y]: [Clear, low-level engineering description of the specific sub-task goal, explicitly embedding OWASP compliance rules and comprehensive technical implementation details]
##### [Translate "Assigned Sub-Agent"]: [Insert exactly ONE unique literal Agent token: Coder | Tester | Reviewer | Doc | Docker | GCP | GKE]
##### [Translate "Targeted Components & Technical Requirements"]:
* **[Translate "Target Path"]:** [Insert the explicit, decentralized physical file path target. For Coder/Tester/Reviewer agents, you MUST expand generic directory boundaries into precise enterprise layered structures, forcing valid file-level dot extensions like `.java`, `.ts`, `.sql`, etc. If it is a Java application layer, you MUST enforce the Maven/Gradle full corporate package structural path segment: `/org/nlh4j/saas/<project_name_alphanumeric_lowercase>/[layer_package]/file.java`. For Tester integration scopes without a single source file, output exactly: `INTEGRATION_SCOPE;<relative_test_file_path>`.]
* **[Translate "Traceability Tag Tokens"]:** <!--START_TAGS-->[REQ-XXX], [DAT-XXX], [EXC-XXX]<!--END_TAGS-->
* **Low-Level Technical Task Instruction:** <RULE>Output exhaustive, high-density engineering instructions, validation schemas, or API contract parameters fully translated into {% if language and language.strip() != "" %}{{ language }}{% else %}English{% endif %}, attaching explicit Tag IDs.</RULE>

# 🚨 DYNAMIC ARCHITECTURAL CONTENT GATING (IF-ACTIVE RAIL PROTOCOL):
* **Database Schema DDL SQL Specification [DAT-XXX]:** <RULE>You MUST actively check the active Sub-Agent for this DAY. If and ONLY IF the task involves database migrations, SQL, scripts, or persistence engines, you MUST explicitly CLONE AND REPLICATE 100% OF THE EXACT RAW TEXT, fields, constraints, and casing of the SQL blocks defined STRICTLY INSIDE THE BOUNDARY OF "Phase {{ phase_idx }}" within the Global Context. You are CRITICALLY BANNED from looking at or pulling artifacts from any other phase blocks. If the task is FrontendUI/DevOps/Testing and has NO database work, you MUST completely delete and eliminate this entire bullet point from the output buffer.</RULE>
* **API and Event Routing Contracts [REQ-XXX], [ARC-XXX]:** <RULE>You MUST actively check the active Sub-Agent for this DAY. If and ONLY IF the task involves backend service microservices, route contracts, or event brokers, you MUST explicitly CLONE AND REPLICATE 100% OF THE EXACT RAW JSON/text metadata blocks defined STRICTLY INSIDE THE BOUNDARY OF "Phase {{ phase_idx }}" within the Global Context. You are CRITICALLY BANNED from cross-contaminating data from adjacent phases. If the task involves ONLY frontend components, containerization, or infrastructure, you MUST completely delete and eliminate this entire bullet point from the output buffer.</RULE>
* **Phase Localized Exception Handlers [EXC-XXX]:** <RULE>You MUST actively check the active Sub-Agent for this DAY. If and ONLY IF the task contains explicit business validation boundaries or system exceptions, CLONE the handlers exactly from the isolated "Phase {{ phase_idx }}" section of the Global Context. Otherwise, completely delete and eliminate this entire bullet point from the output buffer.</RULE>
