# 🚨 MANDATORY ARCHITECTURAL GENERATION CODES
*You must fully engineer the blueprint report by strictly implementing exactly three engineering protocols:*

#### 🎯 PROTOCOL 1: Dynamic Topology Path Prefixing
  - You MUST dynamically match the physical directory file path masks to the active system topology extracted from the raw requirements.
  - Every single generated path parameter string inside the log (`target_component`) MUST utilize the strict Unix forward-slash `/` character as the structural directory delimiter.
  - You are CRITICALLY AND PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN from utilizing the package dot notation `.` inside folder names or file boundaries.
  - Do NOT emit relative paths that assume a sub-module directory is the root:
    * *IF Backend logic/layer is active:* All backend code, services, database schemas, and database tests must reside strictly under: `./sources/backend/` (If Microservices topology is active, you MUST utilize the alphanumeric lowercase service name as the sub-folder path, e.g., `./sources/backend/<service-name>/`). Skip entirely if project is Frontend-only.
    * *IF Frontend logic/layer is active:* All client interfaces, responsive views, mobile bundles, and web tests must reside strictly under: `./sources/frontend/` (or `./sources/frontend/<app-name>/` if multiple client applications exist. Skip entirely if project is Backend-only).
    * *IF DevOps infrastructure logic is active:* All deployment manifests, Dockerfiles, GKE orchestrations, and cloud provisioning scripts must reside strictly under: `./sources/infra/`.
    * *For Document Asserts:* Prefix paths strictly with: `./sources/docs/`.
    * For alternative topologies (AI/Data, IoT, Embedded): Paths must strictly map to logical root subdirectories matching the service domain layer under `./sources/`.
  - Any component path emitted that replaces a forward slash `/` with a directory dot `.` triggers a fatal pipeline integrity exception.

#### 🗄️ PROTOCOL 2: Granular Ceilings-Compliant Task Logs
  - For each calculated phase necessary to cover the BA inputs (Up to the absolute maximum ceiling of {{ num_phases }} phases), supply a clean chronological daylog breakdown (Up to the absolute ceiling of {{ max_days_per_phase }} days per phase). Every single day generated MUST explicitly define the specific assigned sub-agent persona ('Coder' | 'Tester' | 'Reviewer' | 'Doc' | 'Docker' | 'GCP' | 'GKE'), the low-level technical step target, the exact tracking Tag IDs, and the explicit physical relative file path (`target_component`).

#### 🧮 PROTOCOL 3: 100% Vertical Tag Traceability Coverage (ZERO BUNDLING POLICY)
  - Every single feature, entity, database table column, validation, exception, or infrastructure component outlined across your report MUST be strictly prefixed or appended with the exact corresponding Tag IDs (`[REQ-XXX]`, `[EXC-XXX]`, `[DAT-XXX]`, `[NFR-XXX]`) inherited from the requirements. 
  - You are STRICTLY BANNED from bundling tags together (e.g., NO `[REQ-001-005]`). Every single tag must be written out individually and separated by commas. Leaving any task or field without its trace tracking identifier inline is a critical framework violation.

#### 🚨 SUB-AGENT BOUNDARY & RESPONSIBILITY ISOLATION MATRIX
  You MUST strictly isolate the architectural responsibilities of all Sub-Agents listed below. They are separate functional pillars and must NEVER bleed into each other's domain:
  - 💻 **Coder Agent Role**:
    * Core Duty: Pure Application Source Code Implementation.
    * Allowed Actions: Write, refactor, and implement structural logic in application files.
    * Strict Boundary: Forbidden from writing test suites or enterprise architectural documentation.
  - 🧪 **Tester Agent Role**:
    * Core Duty: Test Suite Engineering and Validation.
    * Allowed Actions: Write unit tests, integration tests, and automation scripts. 
    * Strict Boundary: Must strictly use the target-test semi-colon pair syntax for `target_component` (`target_test_file;source_code_file`). Forbidden from writing production application code.
  - 🔍 **Reviewer Agent Role**:
    * Core Duty: Code Review, Issue/Bug Analysis and Fix Strategy.
    * Allowed Actions: Inspect code quality, enforce programming standards, detect optimization bottlenecks, analyze structural issues/bugs, and design explicit fix implementations.
  - 📝 **Doc Agent Role**:
    * Core Duty: Enterprise Technical Document Writer.
    * Allowed Actions: Author high-quality Markdown technical specifications, architecture blueprints, API references, and system compliance documents.
  - 🐳 **Docker Agent Role**:
    * Core Duty: Containerization and Package Registry Pushing.
    * Allowed Actions: Build multi-stage Dockerfiles and push container images to target registries.
  - ☁️ **GCP Agent Role**:
    * Core Duty: Baseline Google Cloud Platform Infrastructure Provisioning.
    * Allowed Actions: Build, push configurations, manage core cloud services (VPC, IAM, Storage), and orchestrate general cloud pipeline deployments.
  - ☸️ **GKE Agent Role**:
    * Core Duty: Google Kubernetes Engine Workload Orchestration.
    * Allowed Actions: Build, push configuration files, design Kubernetes deployment manifests, and manage container scaling and release strategies inside GKE clusters.

#### 🔢 EQUAL REQUIREMENT DISTRIBUTION & ZERO-FILLER DAY-CAP PROTOCOL
  - **Phase Boundary Count**: The total number of architectural phases MUST be exactly "{{ num_phases }}".
  - **Requirement Distribution Mandate**: You MUST distribute 100% of all provided project requirements into exactly "{{ num_phases }}" phases. No requirement can be left unassigned, omitted, or bundled lazily. Every phase from Phase 1 to Phase "{{ num_phases }}" must receive a balanced subset of requirements.
  - **Strict Day-Cap & Anti-Filler Rail**:
    * The maximum number of days within ANY single phase is strictly capped at: "{{ max_days_per_phase }}".
    * The actual number of days per phase can be LESS than or EQUAL to "{{ max_days_per_phase }}" (e.g., `actual_days <= max_days_per_phase`).
    * 🚨 **STRICT FORBIDDEN DIRECTIVE**: You are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN from creating "filler days", redundant testing sessions, unnecessary sync setups, or placeholder tasks just to padding the day count up to the maximum limit. If a phase only requires 2 high-density days to fully implement its assigned requirements, you MUST stop at Day 2. Do not hallucinate Day 3 or Day 4.
    * Every generated day must contain high-utility, actionable enterprise engineering tasks. No empty or duplicate logs.

#### 🚨 CRITICAL FULL TRANSLATION MANDATE
  - The target generation language for all human-readable outputs is permanently bound to: "{% if language and language.strip() != "" %}{{ language }}{% else %}English{% endif %}". Everything MUST be translated into {% if language and language.strip() != "" %}{{ language }}{% else %}English{% endif %}, except for the explicit Technical English core tokens protected by system mandates.
  - You MUST fully translate 100% of all headers, section titles, sub-headers, descriptive text, sentences, explanations, phase objectives, phase descriptions, phase section headers / titles / sub-headers / pullet titles, and task instructions into the designated target language.

#### 🚨 DYNAMIC INTERNATIONALIZATION & TRANSLATION ENGINE
  - Target Output Language Context: "{% if language and language.strip() != "" %}{{ language }}{% else %}English{% endif %}"
  - You MUST dynamically translate 100% of all user-facing structural components, table headers, phase layouts, and list prefixes into the designated Target Output Language Context.
  - 🚨 MANDATORY STRUCTURAL MAPPING DIRECTIVE (Translate these dynamically based on the target language context):
    * All Section and Sub-section Headers (including entire header of ouput markdown report, example `GLOBAL PROJECT CONTEXT`) MUST be translated contextually.
    * Table Headers MUST be translated (e.g., in Vietnamese: `Phase` -> `Giai đoạn`, `Day Range` -> `Khoảng ngày`, `Component / Module Path` -> `Đường dẫn Cấu phần / Module`, `Deliverables Summary` -> `Tóm tắt Sản phẩm Bàn giao`, `Sub-Agent` -> `Sub-Agent`, `Targeted Tag IDs` -> `Tag IDs Mục tiêu`).
    * List Prefixes and Phase Titles MUST be translated (e.g., in Vietnamese: `Phase [X] Detailed Architectural Specification` -> `Đặc tả Kiến trúc Chi tiết Giai đoạn [X]`, `Phase Core Objective & Purpose` -> `Mục tiêu Cốt lõi & Mục đích của Giai đoạn`, `Target Physical Directory Matrix Map` -> `Ma trận Bản đồ Thư mục Vật lý Mục tiêu`, `Database Schema DDL SQL Specification` -> `Đặc tả DDL SQL Schema Cơ sở Dữ liệu`, `API and Event Routing Contracts` -> `Hợp đồng Định tuyến API và Sự kiện`).
  - 🚨 SPECIFIC SECTION CONTENT TRANSLATION RAILS:
    * For Sections 1 & 2: Translate all comprehensive technical overviews, main headers, sub-headers, section titles, labels, table columns, ecosystem descriptions, stack details, and asynchronous channel analysis.
    * For Section 3: Translate all , main headers, sub-headers, section titles, labels, table columns, descriptions of workspace rules, compliance standards, and condition explanations.
    * For Section 4 & 5: Translate all table headers (except technical tokens), main headers, sub-headers, section titles, labels, table columns, deliverables summaries, core objectives, localized exception handling descriptions, and low-level task instruction texts.
    * For Sections 6, 7 & 8: Translate all detail descriptions of injection countermeasures, main headers, sub-headers, section titles, labels, table columns, security rails, hybrid compliance rules, SEO mechanisms, and pipeline git flow gating rules.
  - 🚨 RIGID TECHNICAL BOUNDARY & TECHNICAL EXCLUSION ZONE (DO NOT TRANSLATE): You are strictly forbidden from translating or modifying technical structures, including:
    * All markdown syntax layout operators (`#`, `##`, `###`, `|`, `:`, `-`, `*`) and numerical hierarchy indices (e.g., `1.`, `1.1.`) MUST remain unaltered to preserve the document layout integrity.
    * 🚨 **SUPREME ARCHITECTURE HEADER TRANSLATION MANDATE:** You MUST fully translate into the target language 100% of high-level overview terms, system architecture descriptions, or blueprint documentation titles (even if they are written in full uppercase or encapsulated inside strong markdown bold formatting `**`, such as: `SYSTEM OVERVIEW`, `CORE ARCHITECTURE MODALITY`, `PROJECT CONTEXT`). You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from treating these architectural section names as technical identifier strings to bypass translation. The structure `## 🏛️ 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW` MUST be processed and rendered exactly as `## 🏛️ 1. TỔNG QUAN HỆ THỐNG`.
    * All code blocks (SQL DDL, JSON schemas, JSON payloads, Java, etc.) and Mermaid flow diagrams.
    * All tracking Tag IDs (e.g., `[REQ-XXX]`, `[DAT-XXX]`, `[EXC-XXX]`, `[NFR-XXX]`, `[ARC-XXX]`).
    * All raw physical file paths starting with `./sources/` and the Tester semi-colon pair syntax.
    * All strict literal tokens for Sub-Agent names (`Coder`, `Tester`, `Reviewer`, `Doc`, `Docker`, `GCP`, `GKE`).
    * All hidden HTML comment tags, system data splitters, and data extraction anchors (e.g., `<!--START_DELIMITTER-->`, `<!--END_DELIMITTER-->`, `[PAYLOAD_DELIMITER]`). These must remain in their original raw character format to prevent backend processing errors.
    * Retain all raw engineering strings: file paths (`./sources/...`), code blocks, Tag IDs (`[REQ-XXX]`, `[DAT-XXX]`, etc.), and strict Sub-Agent literal tokens (`Coder`, `Tester`, `Reviewer`, `Doc`, `Docker`, `GCP`, `GKE`).
    * 🚨 **STRICT CODE BLOCK FORMATTING LAW**: You are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN from nesting or combining markdown code block ticks. When outputting a JSON payload, you MUST start exactly with a single line of triple backticks followed immediately by 'json' (i.e., ```json). Do NOT prepend or wrap it with ```text or any other outer text syntax. The block must open clean and close clean.
    * **Static Pass Tag `<NO_TRANSLATION>...</NO_TRANSLATION>`**: Used for static assets. You MUST pass 100% of the internal content literal without any localization, alteration, processing, or computation.
    * **Dynamic Generation Tag `<DYNAMIC_DATA_ENGLISH_ONLY>...</DYNAMIC_DATA_ENGLISH_ONLY>`**: Used for dynamic instructions or mock templates. You MUST process, evaluate variables, and dynamically compute the generation outputs inside this block. However, 100% of the newly generated text stream resulting from this block MUST be strictly rendered in **Technical English** only, with an absolute ban on translation into the target language. The boundary tags MUST be stripped from the final output stream upon execution.

## 4. HIGH-LEVEL MULTI-PHASE ARCHITECTURAL SYNOPSIS GRID

### 4.1. MASTER ARCHITECTURAL PRODUCT BACKLOG
<RULE>
- You MUST generate a comprehensive, unified Master Product Backlog table directly under this section before organizing the multi-phase timeline. This table acts as the definitive grounding index for 100% of the project scope.
- **STRICT BACKLOG COMPLETENESS COMPLIANCE LAW:** This master table MUST completely map and exhaustively list every engineering effort required by the corpus, strictly verified by the Type column:
  1. *Application Code:* Functional endpoint creations, database models, and service layer code blocks.
  2. *Enterprise Documentation:* Complete systemic blueprints, database schema topologies, localized operational manual files, and API contracts located under `./sources/docs/`.
  3. *DevOps Infrastructure:* Containerization scripts (Docker), cloud environment setups (GCP via Terraform), and orchestration cluster manifests (GKE).
- **100% INVARIANT TRACEABILITY LINKAGE:** Every row in this backlog MUST enforce absolute coverage of all relevant tracking tags (`[REQ-XXX]`, `[DAT-XXX]`, `[ARC-XXX]`, `[EXC-XXX]`, `[NFR-XXX]`). Zero orphan requirements or untagged deliverables are permitted.
- **MANDATORY CASCADE PLAN COMPLIANCE:** Every task documented in this Master Backlog table MUST cascade symmetrically downwards: it MUST be distributed into exactly one targeted phase in the Synopsis Grid under Section 4.2, and subsequently possess an explicit, standalone daily execution sub-task log inside Section 5 for that specific phase.
- The Master Product Backlog table layout MUST strictly execute inside the hidden framework parsing hooks exactly as formatted below (inside the hidden HTML tags from `<!--START_BACKLOG_SYNOPSIS_GRID-->` to `<!--END_BACKLOG_SYNOPSIS_GRID-->`)
</RULE>

<!--START_BACKLOG_SYNOPSIS_GRID-->

| No. | Task | Technical Purpose / Deliverables Summary | Type | TagID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
- **TASK ATOMICITY LAW:** You are STRICTLY BANNED from summarizing, grouping, or clustering multiple operational requirement bullets into a single generic task row to save token space.
- **1:1 TRACEABILITY RATIO:** Every unique functional or non-functional Tag ID identified in the raw SRS ([REQ], [ARC], [EXC], [DAT], [NFR]) MUST yield exactly one (1) dedicated, standalone row in this table.
- **OUTPUT LAYOUT PARSING STRUCTURE:**

| [Index] | [Task Title] | [Technical Objective] | [Type] | [Tag IDs] |  <!--REGISTERED_BACKLOG_TASK_ROW-->
| **SUMMARY** | **Total System Backlog Workload Deliverables** | **TOTAL:** [Compute and insert the absolute mathematical sum of all listed task rows, e.g., 42 Tasks] | **STATUS:** Verified | **COVERAGE:** 100% |

<!--END_BACKLOG_SYNOPSIS_GRID-->
{% endif %}

{% if force_full_export or (target_segment and target_segment.strip() == "PART_1_MATRIX_4_2") %}
### 4.2. MULTI-PHASE SYNOPSIS MATRIX

{% if (target_segment and target_segment.strip() == "PART_1_MATRIX_4_2") %}

- **INPUT GROUNDING DATA:** You MUST analyze the generated Master Backlog below to distribute tasks symmetrically across phases:
<master_backlog_context>
{{ master_backlog_context }}
</master_backlog_context>

{% endif %}

Generate a clean, highly structured Markdown Table mapping the exact distribution of components and Tag IDs across the dynamically calculated phases. You MUST compute the most optimal number of phases (denoted as N, where N <= {{ num_phases }}) that naturally and completely covers 100% of the BA requirements and Tag IDs.
<RULE>
[STRICT TABLE EMITTING MANDATE]
- You MUST dynamically analyze the comprehensive tasks generated in '4.1 MASTER ARCHITECTURAL PRODUCT BACKLOG' immediately above.
- You MUST systematically divide and CONSOLIDATE the entire workload into EXACTLY AND ONLY {{ num_phases }} distinct rows. 
- CRITICAL INDEX CEILING: The maximum phase index allowed is {{ num_phases }}. You are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN from generating Phase {{ num_phases + 1 }} or creating a separate phase row for every single backlog task. You MUST group and aggregate multiple tasks from 4.1 together into these {{ num_phases }} milestones.
- For each phase row, you are critically ordered to enforce absolute information symmetry by scanning all Tag IDs and Task types from section 4.1.
- CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE RULE: If you detect any DevOps, Cloud, Deployment, CI/CD, Containerization, or Infrastructure tasks in section 4.1 (such as Docker, GCP, GKE, Kubernetes, or Git pipelines), you MUST explicitly list the path (e.g., './sources/infrastructure/devops/') in the Component column, and you MUST permanently declare 'DevOps' alongside Coder, Tester, Reviewer, and Doc in the 'Assigned Sub-Agent' column for that targeted phase. Do not drop the DevOps agent under any circumstance.
- TIME RAILS: Every phase duration is strictly bound. The Day Range column for each row MUST read exactly 'Day 1 - {{ max_days_per_phase }}'. No variation or estimation allowed.
- Each row MUST specify a real-world engineering duration bounded between 1 to a strict upper ceiling of {{ max_days_per_phase }} days maximum per phase. Do NOT generate empty rows, placeholder phases, or artificial workloads. If the requirements are fully satisfied within fewer than {{ num_phases }} phases, terminate the matrix setup immediately at phase N.
- LOCAL DAY RANGE BOUNDARY: In the "Day Range" column of this table, you MUST format the day sequence starting from relative integer 1 for EACH individual phase row (e.g., Phase 1: Day 1 - 2, Phase 2: Day 1 - 2). Compounding or running a linear progressive day count across phase boundaries is strictly prohibited.
- DYNAMIC TECHNICAL DENSITY PRICING LAW (Project-Agnostic): Each row's "Day Range" MUST be computed dynamically based strictly on the actual volume and density of the allocated Tag IDs for that specific phase. You MUST evaluate the capacity weight: a single calculated operational calendar day log inside Section 5 MUST NOT contain more than 3 unique critical requirement tags (REQ/ARC/NFR) combined. If a phase contains low-density tasks, you MUST stop the index immediately (e.g., closing tightly at Day 1-2).
- IMMUTABLE SYNOPSIS GRID WRAPPER MANDATE: When generating this section (Section 4) Markdown table, you ARE ABSOLUTELY AND CRITICALLY BANNED from dropping, omitting, or filtering out the technical hidden HTML comment anchors. You MUST explicitly enclose the entire generated table structure strictly between the literal tokens <!--START_PHASE_SYNOPSIS_GRID--> and <!--END_PHASE_SYNOPSIS_GRID-->.
- DYNAMIC DAY TITLE ENFORCEMENT: Inside Section 5, for every chronological day element (e.g., - **Day [Y]**:), you ARE PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN from outputting static placeholder strings like "SHORT OBJECTIVE FOR THIS OPERATIONAL CALENDAR DAY". You MUST dynamically analyze the requirements for that day, compile a concise technical objective sentence, and fully translate it into the target language requested by the parameters.
- SUPREME DEMAND-DRIVEN WORKLOAD DISTRIBUTION LAW (ADAPTIVE LIFECYCLE): You MUST orchestrate the project planning by decomposing the absolute sum of all requirements (business functions, enterprise documentation components, and DevOps infrastructure pipelines) dynamically across {{ num_phases }} without any artificial padding or redundant agent forcing:
  1. Dynamic Resource Allocation Rule: A sub-agent ([Coder], [Tester], [Reviewer], [Doc], [Docker], [GCP], or [GKE]) MUST ONLY be declared in the Section 4.2 table row under 'Assigned Sub-Agent' if and ONLY if there are active, unfulfilled backlog requirements matching that agent's engineering domain within that specific phase context. If a phase contains zero infrastructure tasks, DevOps agents MUST be completely omitted from that specific row.
  2. Strict 1:1 Plan Symmetry Guardrail: If a sub-agent token is actively triggered and listed under the 'Assigned Sub-Agent' column for a phase in Section 4.2, you MUST guarantee that the same agent possesses at least one explicit, standalone technical task block inside Section 5 for that phase. Unassigned agents in Section 4.2 MUST NOT possess any tasks in Section 5.
  3. Hard Phase & Timeline Ceilings: The plan MUST split into exactly {{ num_phases }} phases, and no phase timeline block inside Section 5 shall exceed {{ max_days_per_phase }} calendar days.
  4. Zero Filler Data / Ghost Logs: You are strictly prohibited from generating ghost actions, repetitive task summaries, or empty calendar days simply to reach the maximum day limit. If the core deliverables for a phase are fully satisfied, the schedule stops immediately.
  5. 100% Traceability Matrix Coverage: Every active daily log and target component MUST map 100% of all relevant tracking tags ([REQ-XXX], [DAT-XXX], [ARC-XXX], [EXC-XXX], [NFR-XXX]) from the input corpus. Zero orphan requirements or unmapped tags are permitted.
- STRICT SUB-AGENT FILE-EXTENSION & MARKDOWN FENCE COMPLIANCE LAW: You MUST strictly isolate physical file extensions based on the active operating persona and protect layout rendering from syntax breakage:
  1. For [Coder] and [Reviewer]: The target_component MUST strictly point to a physical executable source file ending with valid production extensions (e.g., .java, .ts, .sql).
  2. For [Tester]: The target_component MUST strictly utilize the semicolon pair format containing valid test suffix extensions (e.g., .java, .ts, .spec.ts) matching Case 1 or Case 2 patterns.
  3. For [Doc]: The target_component MUST permanently target granular, individual documentation files ending strictly with the .md extension, located inside ./sources/docs/.
  4. Markdown Render Integrity: You ARE ABSOLUTELY BANNED from outputting naked triple backticks (```) for inner specifications (such as ```sql:matrix or ```json) inside an active root code fence. Every inner code segment block embedded within the day-by-day logs MUST utilize distinct delimiter tokens to ensure parsing isolation. You MUST strictly use exactly four backticks (````) or five backticks (`````) for the top-level parent envelope if the interior values require a three-backtick string literal expression.
- ABSOLUTE DISCRETE SUB-TASK SEPARATION MANDATE: You ARE PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN from aggregating or grouping distinct agent actions into a single combined description block or combined agent field. Every day log inside Section 5 MUST expand into an array of isolated, independent sub-task items, where each sub-task is exclusively mapped to exactly one naked sub-agent persona token.
- CRITICAL COMPACT PATCH & REVIEWER PARADIGM DIRECTIVE: The [Reviewer] MUST operate strictly in a sequential multi-step gating paradigm immediately following the [Coder] execution block inside the daily sub-task sequence. The Reviewer MUST systematically analyze the Coder's generated source assets to verify compiler stability and architectural compliance. If the compiler audit passes with zero issues, the Reviewer task freezes instantly with a no-op status. If and ONLY IF an explicit syntax anomaly, structural bottleneck, or compilation breakdown is detected, the Reviewer MUST trigger a defensive patching directive to execute immediate, target-specific code corrections. All patch instructions MUST be written as concise, structural pseudo-steps or high-density technical instructions; you are absolutely banned from embedding long walls of duplicate raw source code blocks inside the instruction description.
- GRANULAR DELIVERABLE CHECKLIST MANDATE: You MUST inject multiple verification and architectural tasks into the "Technical Deliverables Summary" column for every phase row:
  1. For Tester: Force the inclusion of concrete validation targets, explicitly stating the production of JUnit suites, Integration Tests, and end-to-end (E2E) automation execution profiles.
  2. For Doc: Force the inclusion of architecture alignment requirements, explicitly stating the generation of system technical documentation blueprints and API technical specifications.
- ABSOLUTE ARCHITECTURAL PLAN SYMMETRY MANDATE (ANTI-DESYNC): You MUST enforce strict 1:1 deterministic alignment between the global macro-plan in Section 4.2 (<!--START_PHASE_SYNOPSIS_GRID-->) and the granular micro-logs in Section 5. It is a critical system violation to declare sub-agents in the synopsis table row while leaving them with zero execution tasks in the corresponding daily breakdown.
- **ABSOLUTE MATHEMATICAL BACKLOG COUPLING LAW:** You MUST ensure flawless mathematical synchronization between the total task count generated in the Master Backlog table (Section 4.1 Summary Row) and the accumulated count of discrete sub-task nodes produced across all phases inside Section 5. 
- You ARE ABSOLUTELY BANNED from dropping, truncating, or abstracting any task from Section 4.1 when expanding the timeline logs. Every individual functional index or document artifact registered in the Master Backlog table MUST expand into exactly one standalone execution sub-task node within its designated calendar day block inside Section 5. Under-counting, omitting tasks, or prematurely stopping the sub-task sequence before satisfying 100% of the Master Backlog rows constitutes a fatal compliance crash.
- DETERMINISTIC DISTRIBUTION PATTERN PER PHASE: For 100% of the phases generated, if a sub-agent token ([Coder], [Tester], [Reviewer], [Doc], [Docker], [GCP], or [GKE]) is registered under the 'Assigned Sub-Agent' column in Section 4.2, you MUST partition the phase timeline chunk so that EVERY listed agent possesses at least one explicit, standalone, independent technical sub-task block inside Section 5 for that specific phase.
- BALANCED MULTI-AGENT TIMELINE PACKING: To fit multiple required agents within narrow day-ranges without inflating the timeline or violating the dynamic technical density ceiling, you MUST execute compact parallel or sequential distribution:
  1. Early phase timeline segments MUST be optimized for application-layer loops where [Coder] and [Doc] execute in parallel sub-tasks, immediately followed sequentially by [Reviewer] quality gates and [Tester] automated suites.
  2. Concluding phase timeline segments MUST be strictly cleared of application tasks and dedicated to sequential infrastructure workflows handled exclusively by [Docker], [GCP], and [GKE] sub-agents to deliver automated environment setups and deployment manifests.
- **DYNAMIC DAY-RANGE MATCHING LAW:** In Section 4.2 Matrix, the "Day Range" column value MUST strictly match the exact calendar days you will generate in Section 5. If Section 5 stops at DAY 5, Section 4.2 MUST write 'Day 1 - 5'. You are BANNED from hardcoding 'Day 1 - {{ max_days_per_phase }}' if the actual workload finishes earlier.
- **DYNAMIC DAY-RANGE MATCHING LAW:** In Section 4.2 Matrix, the "Day Range" column value MUST strictly match the exact calendar days you will generate in Section 5. If Section 5 stops at DAY 5, Section 4.2 MUST write 'Day 1 - 5'. You are BANNED from hardcoding 'Day 1 - {{ max_days_per_phase }}' if the actual workload finishes earlier.
- **TOTAL WORKLOAD COVERAGE SYMMETRY:** The sum of all unique Tag IDs distributed across all phases in Section 4.2 MUST match 100% symmetrically with the tags registered in Section 4.1. Dropping or hiding tasks between Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 triggers a fatal pipeline integrity exception.
</RULE>

<!--START_PHASE_SYNOPSIS_GRID-->

| Phase | Day Range | Architectural Component / Module Path | Technical Deliverables Summary | Assigned Sub-Agent | Targeted Tag IDs |
- **DYNAMIC RANGE COMPUTE LAW:** The "Day Range" column MUST NOT be hardcoded. You MUST dynamically compute the exact number of days (denoted as K, where K <= {{ max_days_per_phase }}) based on workload density. 
- **FORMAT ENFORCEMENT:** You MUST write the computed range exactly as 'Day 1 - K' (e.g., 'Day 1 - 3' if the work finishes on Day 3). Do NOT write 'Day 1 - {{ max_days_per_phase }}' if there is no work to fill those days.
- **TOTAL TAG COVERAGE:** The "Targeted Tag IDs" column in this grid MUST contain the union of all Tag IDs defined in Section 4.1 for that phase.
- **ZERO OMISSION RULE:** If a Tag ID exists in Section 4.1, it MUST appear in Section 4.2. Truncating or omitting tags to save space is a fatal error.

[STRICT OPERATIONAL MANDATE FOR PHASE {{ target_phase_index }} OUT OF {{ num_phases }}]
- OPERATIONAL SCOPE: You are now executing target segment 'PART_2_PHASE_LOOP' exclusively for Phase {{ target_phase_index }} out of {{ num_phases }}.
- TIME BOUNDARY: You are strictly capped to generate chronological daily logs exactly from Day 1 to Day {{ max_days_per_phase }}. Absolutely FORBIDDEN from generating any text, sub-headers, or tasks for Day {{ max_days_per_phase + 1 }} or beyond. Match this duration with your declaration inside Section 4.2 matrix.
- DYNAMIC MATRIX AUDIT: Scan the historic '## 4.2 MULTI-PHASE SYNOPSIS MATRIX' table generated in the previous step. Locate the exact row matching 'Phase {{ target_phase_index }}'.
- AGENT ENFORCEMENT: Extract all assigned roles from the 'Assigned Sub-Agent' column in that specific row (including Coder, Tester, Reviewer, Doc, Docker, GCP, GKE). You MUST explicitly output separate chronological sub-task blocks for EVERY single sub-agent declared in that row. If Docker/GCP/GKE infrastructure tokens are active, you are strictly commanded to engineer their cloud deployment and cluster setup logs inline. Do not drop any role.
- COMPONENT ENFORCEMENT: Extract the exact 'Architectural Component / Module Path' from that row. All generated repository paths, migrations, and file configurations in this chunk MUST target that path.
- REAL-TIME MATHEMATICAL SELF-AUDIT (CRITICAL): 
  * If this is the FINAL phase (Phase {{ num_phases }}), you MUST look inside the `<HISTORIC_LEDGER_MAP>` block below.
  * Count the total number of `<!--START_ATOMIC_SUB_TASK_NODE-->` string instances printed inside that map block (which represents the exact count of sub-tasks from all previous phases).
  * Mentally add the count of new sub-tasks you are currently generating in this exact response.
  * You MUST compute the absolute total sum integer and output it directly into the `TOTAL_DISCRETE_SUB_TASKS_GENERATED_IN_SECTION_5` field inside the properties block. No formulas or string placeholders allowed.
- OUTPUT RESTRICTION: Absolutely DO NOT output or duplicate the main global document titles, table controls, project context overviews, or other phases. Start your generation immediately from the localized sub-header: '### Phase {{ target_phase_index }}'.

### GROUNDING CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS STEPS
Below is the definitive Master Product Backlog generated in Part 1. You MUST align your daylog task titles, Tag IDs, and components 100% symmetrically with this blueprint:

{% if force_full_export or target_phase_index == 1 %}
## 5. GRANULAR PHASE SPECIALIZATIONS & DAY-BY-DAY DELIVERABLES
{% endif %}

<COMMAND>
# STRICT 1:1 SYNOPSIS MIRROR MANDATE:
- Section 5 MUST act as a strict structural mirror of the dynamic phases calculated in Section 4. You MUST generate an independent, complete detailed block below for EVERY phase sequence from Phase 1 up to Phase N (where N <= {{ num_phases }}). Absolutely no phase that has been calculated in section 4 can be omitted.
- Truncating, omitting, or combining phases is an absolute pipeline violation. You are strictly commanded to detail every phase that appeared in your Section 4 table.

# DYNAMIC CEILING BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT:
- For each active Phase [X], the day-by-day logs MUST strictly map to the exact day range defined for that phase in Section 4.
    * **🚨 STRICT TOKEN MEMORY GATING LOG (Anti-Cross-Contamination)**: When iterating chronologically day-by-day to extract architectural artifacts (SQL specifications, exception blocks, or API routing contracts), you MUST force a strict state isolation memory partition cleanup between consecutive days.
    * You ARE ABSOLUTELY AND CRITICALLY BANNED from chép lặp lại, ghosting, leaking, or double-rendering a raw code block payload (such as repeating a JSON API endpoint spec payload belonging to Day X) inside the block container of Day X+1 unless explicitly required by an updated multi-step transaction contract. Every single day's artifact layout matrix MUST contain independent, discrete, non-duplicated production elements matching that day's allocated sub-agent scope only.
- **ABSOLUTE LOCAL CHRONO RESET**: When generating the day element sub-headers inside Section 5 (e.g., `- **DAY [Y]:**`), the counter variable Y MUST natively reset and restart from 1 for EVERY single phase block (e.g., Phase 1 contains DAY 1, DAY 2; Phase 2 MUST restart and contain exactly DAY 1, DAY 2). You are permanently forbidden from bleeding the global progressive timeline into these sections.
- The total days within any single phase MUST NOT exceed the absolute upperbound of {{ max_days_per_phase }} days.
- You MUST execute a hard log freeze and terminate the active day loop immediately on the exact day when 100% of the baseline BA tracking codes for Phase [X] are covered. Fabricating dummy tasks or synthetic requirements to pad out the timeline up to {{ max_days_per_phase }} is completely banned.
</COMMAND>

{% if force_full_export %}
- **MONOLITHIC GENERATION EXECUTION RAIL:** You MUST sequentially execute and expand the following structural block for EVERY calculated phase from Phase 1 up to Phase N (where N = {{ num_phases }}) in a continuous stream. For each iteration, dynamically substitute the index X with the current phase number.
{% endif %}

### 📈 [Translated text for "Phase"] {% if force_full_export %}[X]{% else %}{{ target_phase_index }}{% endif %} - [YOU MUST COPIER AND REUSE EXACTLY THE SAME TRANSLATED, HIGH-LEVEL TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE SUMMARY STRING THAT YOU JUST GENERATED FOR THIS SPECIFIC PHASE INSIDE THE SECTION 4.2 SYNOPSIS TABLE. IT MUST MATCH THE TABLE ROW 100%. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY BANNED FROM ALTERING THE MEANING OR USING STATIC ENGLISH LABELS. IT MUST MATCH THE TABLE ROW 100%. EXAMPLES: "Khởi Tạo Hệ Thống Người Dùng Và Xác Thực" OR "Triển Khai Lõi Nghiệp Vụ Khóa Học"]
- **Phase Core Objective & Purpose:** [Detailed technical explanation of what this phase achieves and its functional goals, fully translated into {% if language and language.strip() != "" %}{{ language }}{% else %}English{% endif %}]
- **Target Physical Directory Matrix Map:** List all specific file paths underneath `./sources/` initialized or modified in this phase. Every single line path generated MUST be appended with its tracking Tag IDs inline.
    *   *Documentation Gating Boundary:* Any line representing an enterprise specification, reference blueprint, relational database mapping catalog, or architecture layout MUST strictly reside under the unified root directory path: `./sources/docs/`.
- **Database Schema DDL SQL Specification [DAT-XXX]:** Provide raw, complete, and valid DDL SQL migration statements containing explicit columns, data types, primary/foreign keys, matrix mappings, indexes, and nullability constraints applied under this phase scope. (Omit entirely if the project topology has no database or persistence layer requirements. This technical block MUST NOT be translated).
<RULE>
  * **🚨 UNIVERSAL ANSI SQL DATABASE CONSTRAINT LAW**: Regardless of the active project's core domain or persistence layers, when generating any DDL SQL code block specifications (under code fence ` ```sql:matrix ` or standard blocks), you ARE COMPLETELY BANNED from using non-standard inline database-specific custom types such as inline `ENUM(...)` signatures.
  * You MUST enforce absolute cross-platform relational database compliance by utilizing pure standard ANSI SQL typing mechanics: always represent string enumerations as standard `VARCHAR(X) NOT NULL` fields combined with an explicit, rigid, relational domain check validation gate constraint mapping pattern (exact structure pattern: `CHECK (column_name IN ('value1', 'value2', 'value3'))`). Any output violating this cross-platform constraint will break the migration sequence.
</RULE>
- **API and Event Routing Contracts [REQ-XXX], [ARC-XXX]:** Document the complete technical contracts (precise endpoint paths, HTTP methods, request/response JSON payload schemas, or message broker topic configurations. Technical blocks MUST NOT be translated).
- **Phase Localized Exception Handlers [EXC-XXX]:** Detail explicit business validation rules, error codes, and system exception handling pathways mapping strictly to the current phase scope, contextually translated into {% if language and language.strip() != "" %}{{ language }}{% else %}English{% endif %}.

#### Chronological Day-by-Day Sub-Agent Task Distribution Logs (Phase [X])

<!--START_DAY_LOG_INDEX_{{ target_phase_index }}-->

- **DAY [Y]: SHORT OBJECTIVE FOR THIS OPERATIONAL CALENDAR DAY**
  
##### SUB-TASK [Z]: SHORT SPECIFIC SUB-TASK TITLE
<!--START_ATOMIC_SUB_TASK_NODE-->

<RULE>
- **Local Sub-Task Chrono Reset Law:** The sub-task index variable Z MUST natively reset and restart from 1 for EACH individual calendar day element generated (e.g., Day 1 contains SUB-TASK 1, SUB-TASK 2; Day 2 MUST strictly restart and contain exactly SUB-TASK 1, SUB-TASK 2). Progressively compounding or accumulating sub-task indices across daily boundaries is a critical framework violation.
<RULE>
* **Sub-Agent Workflow Specialization:**
<RULE>
You MUST analyze the daily technical engineering segment and output EXACTLY one single literal token code inside naked brackets representing the allocated persona for this independent sub-task node: [Coder], [Tester], [Reviewer], [Doc], [Docker], [GCP], or [GKE]. You are PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN from combining multiple agents into a single sub-task node or leaking generic instructional text placeholder descriptions.
</RULE>
* **Targeted Tag IDs:**
<RULE>
Write each baseline tracking tag out individually separated by commas, ensuring 100% coverage, e.g., [REQ-001], [DAT-002], [EXC-001].
</RULE>
* **Target Component file path (target_component):**
<RULE>
Insert the explicit physical path starting with `./sources/` or Tester semi-colon pair syntax based strictly on the active persona domain. Append its targeted Tag IDs inline here.
</RULE>
* **Low-Level Technical Task Instruction:**
<RULE>
Output high-density technical instructions, operational validation steps, or schema parameters fully translated into the target language context, attaching explicit inline Tag IDs.
</RULE>

# DYNAMIC ARCHITECTURAL CONTENT GATING (IF-ACTIVE RAIL PROTOCOL):
- STRICT TAG FILTER LAW: You are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN from outputting or mapping any Tag IDs ([REQ-XXX], [DAT-XXX], [ARC-XXX], [EXC-XXX], [NFR-XXX]) inside this active phase block UNLESS that specific Tag ID was explicitly assigned to 'Phase {% if force_full_export %}[X]{% else %}{{ target_phase_index }}{% endif %}' inside the Section 4.2 Multi-Phase Synopsis Matrix table. Completely isolate the data architecture of this targeted phase.
* **Database Schema DDL SQL Specification [DAT-XXX]:**
<RULE>
You MUST actively inspect the active Sub-Agent token inside the parent sub-task node. If and ONLY IF the specific sub-task execution involves physical database migrations, DDL scripts, index creations, or schema constraints, you MUST dynamically render the complete, production-ready ANSI SQL blocks inside this section. If the targeted sub-task handles FrontendUI, document updates, or cloud pipelines with NO database mutations, you MUST completely delete and purge this entire bullet point from the daily output buffer.
</RULE>
* **API and Event Routing Contracts [REQ-XXX], [ARC-XXX]:**
<RULE>
You MUST actively inspect the active Sub-Agent token inside the parent sub-task node. If and ONLY IF the sub-task execution directly involves backend application controllers, routing protocols, microservice API specifications, or event-driven topic bindings, you MUST dynamically generate the complete contract schemas or payload objects inside this section. If the task covers infrastructure or frontend styling alone, you MUST completely prune and delete this entire bullet point from the daily output buffer.
</RULE>
* **Phase Localized Exception Handlers [EXC-XXX]:**
<RULE>
You MUST actively inspect the active Sub-Agent token inside the parent sub-task node. If and ONLY IF the current sub-task scope establishes an explicit business validation boundary, error gating logic, or framework exception mapping pattern, you MUST generate the complete localized handlers. Otherwise, you MUST completely eliminate, erase, and drop this entire bullet point to eliminate layout clutter.

### MANDATORY REAL-TIME ARCHITECTURAL CROSS-AUDIT LEDGER REPORT:
- **TIMING LOCATION:** This compliance ledger MUST be rendered exclusively at the absolute bottom of Section 5, immediately following the final day log of the final phase.
- Immediately beneath the final Phase log (Phase {{ num_phases }}) and before closing Section 5, you MUST execute a strict internal mathematical self-audit of the entire assembled architecture. 
- You MUST compile and render an isolated, clean Markdown Compliance Report block utilizing the exact Technical English structure below. 
- You are critically ordered to dynamically compute the real-world values based strictly on the current generation instance metrics—no hardcoding or static placeholder strings.

```

- **MANDATORY CRITICAL FAILURE CRITERIA:** If your calculated total discrete sub-tasks across all phases does not mathematically match the exact count of tasks registered in the master backlog, or if any individual phase duration breaks the ceiling of `{{ max_days_per_phase }}`, you MUST instantly trigger an internal framework exception, re-compile your attention heads, and dynamically re-distribute the allocation matrix to enforce 100% plan symmetry before emitting the final text stream.
